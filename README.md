# hello-world
This is my first GitHub project
I am a fairly new web developer. I am submersing myself in code, code, code. I am setting out to master javaScript, python, Ruby, and some I don't know about yet. Oh, and many of the frameworks out there. Once I get a good grasp, I'd like to author a framework to use. 

My company is kreativ beetle media development. I will master digital and creative media. These are important to communication in the world, just as body language is. Communication media IS the global body language.

More than that, I want to contribute as much as possible to the world. I believe communication, expression of self, is the basis for freedom - within and without. I'd like to help facilitate this for all people. The universe is abundant. There's more than enough abundancy for ALL people to share and partake.

Peace.
